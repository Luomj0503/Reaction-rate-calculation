        <p>
        Data from the literature, structured and with molecular names converted by SMILES provide molecular fingerprints (MF). Besides, independent variables include
        pH, temperature, S-ZVI concentration and pollutant concentration. While rate constants are the dependent variables of our model developed implemented in six 
        machine learning algorithms – Gradient Boosted Regression Tree(GBRT), Desicion Tree(DT), Support Vector Regression(SVR),XGboost (XBG), Random Forest (RF) 
        and Neural Network (NN).We found that the Neural Network and Gradient Boosted Regression Tree made the best predictions, then interpreted the model by SHAP.

        <p>
        pySiRC was designed to facilitate the automatic researchers to prediction and analyze of reaction rate constants
        using Machine Learning models, since the theoretical calculation and experimental measures of these kinetic
        parameters can be extremely challenging. The tools are designed to be quick and simple users with few clicks
        can make the prediction. The tools are rigorous enough to have applications in academic research.
        All the source code for this application and the steps for local installation are at <a href="https://github.com/Luomj0503/Reaction-rate-calculation/"target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
